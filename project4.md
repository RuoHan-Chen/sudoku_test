## Questions

### 1. Did you use an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to assist you with the completion of this project?

Yes, we used ChatGPT. 

### If yes, was it helpful or not? Provide a brief description of whether it was helpful or not. Also, provide a percentage of how much it helped you in each of the four main tasks (i.e., loading from a file, solving Sudoku, configuring the testing, configuring the GitHub Actions workflow).

ChatGPT was mainly helpful in learning the basics of Rust and seeing how much overlap there was between Rust and other languages we were more familiar with, such as C++. 
Breakdown of usage: 
Loading from a file: 30%
Solving sudoku: 5%
Configuring testing: 
Configuring GitHub Actions workflow: 

### If no, did you search the Internet for solutions? If so, provide the website(s) where you copied a considerable amount of code. For example, the website that you copied the core Sudoku solver.
